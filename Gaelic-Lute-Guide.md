## Parts of Speech

### Pronouns

Pronouns are the simplest class of word we'll be looking at when it comes to Lute, so we'll start there.

#### Basic pronouns

Scottish Gaelic has 7 basic pronouns

| Gaelic | English                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| mi     | I, me                    |
| thu*    | you (singular, informal) |
| e      | he, him                  |
| i      | she, her                 |
| sinn   | we, us                   |
| sibh   | you (plural, formal)     |
| iad    | they, them               |

*The second person singular/informal pronoun "thu" also has a special form "tu" that is used in some situations. You don't really need to care about that until you come across them, but for the sake of completeness, we'll create an entry for it. 

#### Emphatic pronouns

Gaelic also has emphatic forms of the pronouns. These are  used for emphasis, or in certain fixed phrases such as "is mise" ("I am").

| Gaelic       | English                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| mise         | I, me (emphatic)                    |
| thusa, tusa* | you (singular, informal) (emphatic) |
| esan         | he, him (emphatic)                  |
| ise          | she, her (emphatic)                 |
| sinne        | we, us (emphatic)                   |
| sibhse       | you (plural, formal) (emphatic)     |
| iadsan       | they, them (emphatic)               |

*Just like with the basic form, the emphatic version of the second person singular/informal pronoun has a special form that is used in certain situations. 

#### Posessive pronouns

These forms are used to indicate possession (grammatical possession is a bit of an interesting concept in Gaelic, but for our purposes it's not worth going into here). For the most part, each basic form of the pronoun has its own corresponding possessive version; however, there are some issues we'll run into creating entries for some of them in Lute, as you'll see.

| Gaelic | English                   |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| mo     | my                        |
| do     | your (singular, informal) |
| a      | his                       |
| a      | her                       |
| a h-   | her (before a vowel)      |
| ar     | our                       |
| ar n-  | our (before a vowel)      |
| ur     | your (plural, formal)     |
| ur n-  | your (plural, formal) (before a vowel) |
| an     | their                     |
| am     | their (before a labial)   |

As you can see, the forms of the third person possessive pronouns are the same for both the masculine and the feminine! This isn't a problem necessarily, as we could just create an entry like this:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| term | a |
| definition | his, her |

However, as we'll see as we move along, this is a sign of a larger problem looming on the horizon, namely the word "a".

"a" is an extremely overloaded word in Scottish Gaelic, and has no fewer than 9 distinct meanings depending on context. More if you include variant forms of other words that reduce down to just "a", and dialectal forms. 

"a" can mean:
- the masculine possessive pronoun 
- the feminine possessive pronoun
- the relative pronoun (the man THAT I saw)
- a reduced form of preposition "do"
- a reduced form of preposition "de"
- a reduced form of interrogative particle "an"
- the vocative particle
- the infinitive particle
- the counting particle

Furthermore, the possessive pronoun uses can have other forms 

#### Other pronouns



### The Article

Gaelic has only one article: the definite article. However, that one article has a myriad of forms depending on the situation. For our purposes, we won't concern ourselves with the where's and why's of the article and its forms, that's for your grammar study :) If you'd like a more in-depth guide, check out [this article](https://gaelicgrammar.org/~gaelic/mediawiki/index.php/Articles) on the Gaelic Grammar Wiki.
